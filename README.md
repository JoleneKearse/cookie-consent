This is a code-along project from **Scrimba**'s **[Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)**.

_Aside: If you haven't heard of Scrimba, they are a tremendously great learning platform with an in-built editor. You can learn from their teachers and pause the videos and directly code and see your code. They also quite frequently update the learning path. Hence I'm going back to quickly re-do the new projects they keep putting up! I do this when I see interesting new projects, giving me a chance to review concepts._

This is the first project in Module 5 Essential JavaScript Concepts.

## Things I Learned (ie gained a greater understanding of)

### How to center a modal using position fixed
